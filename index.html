                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" alt="profile pic">
                    <p>
                    Amanda has a BA in English and Art, an MA in Theater 
                    and Performance Studies, and currently works in a pharmacy 
                    so, naturally, she thought learning full-stack development would be the next logical 
                    step. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Honestly though, she knows design, creativity, and 
                    how to finish a project. She can think on her feet 
                    and likes building on the works of others both collaboratively 
                    and individually. She thinks most of these skills are 
                    transferable to coding, and she hopes to build more skills 
                    along the way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In her spare time, Amanda likes knitting, painting, playing
                    with dogs, and boxing. She likes to work with her hands
                    and to read long novels. Unsuprisingly, Herman Melville's 
                    Moby-Dick is her favourite book. Her top five favourite 
                    bands are Stars, New Order, The Decemberists, David Bowie, 
                    and Fleet Foxes. Her top five favourite foods are tacos, 
                    pizza, cannoli, bread, and tacos (at the moment, y'all, 
                    because she really loves food of all kinds). Sometimes she uses 
                    British spellings because she lived in England for two 
                    years. One day she wants to have a house and a wife and 
                    a yard so she can actually garden.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Amanda thinks she will be most interested in Front End 
                    Development, but she is very intrigued by the mysteries
                    of the Back End. Her dad works in software development, 
                    so naturally he is pleased as punch that she's taking 
                    an interest in his world. Though, he does wish she was 
                    learning Python. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mostly, Amanda wants to always keep learning and growing. 
                    And also to get really really good at coding.
